<br>
<strong>Why did you build this project?</strong>
<br>
    -I built this project to not only attempt and correct any issues that I saw but a personal goal set for myself to try and exceed my own expectations and implement css properties outside of my comfort level.   
<strong>What problem does it solve?</strong>
<br>
    -One problem that I noticed it solve, was my uncertainity towards being able to defactor any upcoming projects in my future.
